        <p>Now I added a -raw variable allowing me to input code directly in the article. This is so that I don't have to add futures that I use rarely.</p>

        <p>I finally took some time to research about the Java applets. Learned that JApplet is used for website apps and JFrame is used for desktop apps.<br />P.S.: On a quick side note, I changed my keyboard layout to japanese so that I finally have access to "Special" symbols.
