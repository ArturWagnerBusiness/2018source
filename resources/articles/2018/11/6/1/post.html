        <p>Today I only have a news that I am making my school project site which I will link to this blog. Should change the banner soon right?</p>
        <p>Well either way I realized that for some reason the month said October even though it is November. Funny right? Will be more careful during other development to produce higher quality work.</p>
        <p>Well, more posts coming so see you soon!</p>
        <p>P.S. Footer to posts will be added A.S.A.P</p>
