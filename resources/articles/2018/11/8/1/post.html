        <p>I also decided to change the header to this:</p>

        <p>To be able to make my sites better I started looking at the css documentation, which to my surprise was handy to take a look. There is so much that I could learn from there. So for few days you may expect little posting as I will be studying the deep details of css3. I might also look at applets so that there are going to be applications on the website for everyone to use.</p>
