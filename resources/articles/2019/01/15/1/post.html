        <p class="title">Finaly after few days I am happy to present a python based text editor in windows CMD!</p>
        <p>First I want to mention it's possibilities.<br />Firstly you are able to type in using the entire english aphabat including (!?.,' etc.). You are also able to erase and make new lines like in any normal text editor. Midway in the project I decided to make it a lot bigger by changing the command prompt render limit for width and height.</p>

        <p>I was also able to add a menu/tool bar that can be accessed by tapping ESC key. Once clicked, 7 options will be shown to you. Which you can later use up/down arrow key to move or click the corresponding number key. After ENTER is clicked to option is selected.</p>

        <p>Also want to mention an debug more to get some details on what is currently happening. Not detailed but good enought for now.</p>

        <p>I also decided to add Themes that can be switched in the top menu bar. Using the class COLOR you can use colors and using themes as a template you can add move items to it. They are in the following order:<br />itemToColor: [textColor, backgroud, special] (For me special only works for 0 and 1)<br />0 being normal and 1 being a brighter color</p>

        <p>Finaly I want to mention that It was fun writing this software. I may add more things into it however for now that will be it.</p>

        <p class="title">How to run it yourself?</p>
        <p>First I want to give a warning that I didn't yet test the software on any other hardware then my PC. However, if you still want to run it then you can first download it from <a href="https://github.com/Eis3/CMD">github.com/Eis3/CMD</a>. Then you will need to change the directory that options.txt will be made in. Just go to line 10 in main.py and change the options_dir to your prefered directory (Make sure it exists!). After you will need to run the application from a terminal in this manner:<br />python main.py -filename -new/open<br />If you also want you can save the add a runable .bat file like I did and add the folder to system variables. Then you can call the program with the .bat. For example my one is editor.bat that runs the main.py. So I run it with this:<br />editor -filename -new/open.<br /><br />NOTE: It is important to know that the editor uses your current directory as the place to look for the file!</p>
